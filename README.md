# naive_bayes
This my first implementation for the naive bayes technique in ML ...... Any comment will be of a great value for me :)

That's Naive_bayes_from_scratch with the feature of entering your dataset name and your split ratio and see the magic happens.

Example:
```
    python naive_bayes_from_scratch  <name of dataset> <split Ratio>
```
For further Researching I highly suggest this site [Naive Bayes Wizard](https://machinelearningmastery.com/naive-bayes-classifier-scratch-python/)
  
Happy learning :)
